## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM 
- JavaScript 
- ScSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1- Before this challenge the built tool that I used was parcel which is a module bundler with zero confgration but for this projcet I used webpack is the toatal opposite of parcel when is comes to configuation. While you could use default configuration which can save you alot of time I wanted to learn the inner working of webpack and configuring it for this project give a good grasp on basics like loader and entry files. I hade some issue making the HMR(Hot module replacement) work of htm file but it will make a good challenge for the next project.

2- Being stratigiec about the way you import partials or functions in different namespaces can save you alot of typing/time. For instance if you use something like a function that converts pixel value to rem values you can import it once in you main entry file instead of importing is in each partial or having to use a namespace.
```css 
block{
  padding: rem(a value)
}

3- Commit history is really valuable asset for debugging purposes and a bunch of other reason therefore creating a logical and descriptive one is important. A bad practice is to 
only use none-specific commit messages like "added some styles". A much better commit message has the following structure:
  1-Subject 
  2- Body:
    1- what have you changed ?
    2- the purpose of change
    3- dangers 
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
